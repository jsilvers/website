Logrange is an [open-source database](https://github.com/logrange/logrange) for aggegating application logs, metrics, audit logs and other streaming data from thousands of sources. 

Logrange is built around the idea that every piece of data is essential.

Streaming data such as application logs, should be used for [Anomalies Prediction, and Security Alerts](https://logrange.io/blog/2019-05-22-introduction.html).

Logrange strives to achieve the following goals:

- Persisting streaming data should be cheap. No worries, just save whatever you need.
- To provide an API for uniform access to the data from thousands of different sources. All data is in one database.
- To provide tools for the aggregated data further learining and analysis to build an advanced features like AI for the distributed system health.
- Logrange is open-source and secure, to meet high quality standards for transferring, saving and processing data.
- Could be run everywhere either in Cloud or on Premises configurations.
- Easy to run and configure

v0.1.0 of Logrange has been released - and along with it, we release the integration of Logrange into [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity/) by [Gravitational Inc.](https://gravitational.com/)

### What is in the release
The release contains the following components:
- _log collector_ is an executable which allows to scan log-files written by different applications, sending the data into Logrange's database. The _log collectors_ could be run on multiple hosts or side-car containers to collect log data from different sources.
- _log aggregator_ is an executable which accepts data sent by _log collectors_ from different sources to persisting it in one database on the host file-system. The _log aggregator_ provides an API to serve client's requests to the database.
- _log shell_ is an CLI tool, which allows to make requests to the database using  [LQL](link) (Logrange Query Language)
- _log forwarder_ is an executable which allows to make requests to Logrange's database using LQL, forwarding the result to a 3rd party system using _Rsyslog_ protocol

The components above allow:
-  To collect application logs from thousands of sources and store them in Logrange's database
-  To transmit all data securely using TLS protocol
-  To filter and request aggregated data using LQL 
-  To forward all or partial data into 3rd party systems using Rsyslog

Logrange is availiable in the following configurations: 
- _Standalone_. In the configuration all components can be run manually. Try the [quick start](https://github.com/logrange/logrange#quick-start) to see how it works.
- _Kubernetes_. Logrange can be deployed as a log-aggregation system into a Kubernetes cluster. You can find how to run Logrange in Kubernetes [here](https://github.com/logrange/k8s) .

Logrange binaries are avialable for Linux and MacOs platforms on our [Download](link) page. You can run Logrange components either in a cloud or on premises using hosted, virtualized or conteinerized soultions or a mix of them.

Of course, you can build it from [source](https://github.com/logrange/logrange)

### Gravitational starts to use Logrange for Gravity!
[Gravitational Inc.](https://gravitational.com/) starts to use Logrange for serving cluster logs infrastructure in [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity/), their flagman product! Logrange's component are deployed into the Gravity cluster for aggregating the cluster's application logs and providing an interface for working with them. There are 2 main use-cases Logrange addresses in Gravity:
1. Aggergating logs from the applications, that run in the Gravity cluster. Providing an inteface for search and downloading collected logs.
2. Forwarding aggregated logs to a 3rd party system using [Rsyslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsyslog) protocol.

Here is what Sasha Klizhentas (CTO of Gravitational Inc.) says about it:

> [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity] uses Logrange to collect and aggregate log data in the most restricted environments and provides
> our customers with ability to search, retain and forward logs to external log storage without compromising on security or storage.

### The future
Logrange is under active development. Our plan is to continue working on the following items:
- To run Logrange as a cluster, to provide HA
- To provide manual tool for working with logs.
- To support log-storage to meet high-end security standards
- To provide more integration with Logrange database for data visualization and forwarding it to 3rd party system.
- To work on data-analysis tools that allow to build Anomalies Prediction solutions using collected machine data.
