### Introducing Logrange v0.1.0
We are excited to announce our first official release of [Logrange](https://www.github.com/logrange/logrange). This release introduces Logrange database along with the tools for collecting applications' logs.

### What is Logrange?
[Logrange](https://github.com/logrange/logrange) is an open-source streaming database for aggregating application logs, metrics, audit logs and other machine-generated data from thousands of sources.

Logrange is built around the idea that every piece of data is essential. Logrange keeps different types of machine-generated data in one database, what makes it a great source for comprehensive data analysis.

Logrange strives to achieve the following goals:
- Persisting streaming data should be cheap. All data is important, so it should all be saved in a full amount for later processing.
- All data is in one database. Logrange provides an API for uniform access to the data collected from thousands of different sources. 
- To provide tools for the aggregated data further learning and analysis to build an advanced features like AI for the distributed system health.
- Logrange is open-source and secure, to meet high quality standards for transferring, saving and processing data.
- Could be run everywhere either in Cloud or On-Premise configurations.
- Easy to run and configure.

### What is in the release
The release contains the following components:
- _log collector_ allows to scan log-files on a host-machine(s), sending the into Logrange's database. 
- _log aggregator_ is Logrange server. It accepts writes data into the database and provides an API to serve client's requests.
- _log shell_ is Logrange's CLI tool, which allows to make requests to the database using  [LQL](link) (Logrange Query Language)
- _log forwarder_ allows to send data from Logrange database into a 3rd party system using _Rsyslog_ protocol

Logrange is availiable in the following configurations: 
- _Standalone_. In the configuration all components can be run manually. Try [quick start](https://github.com/logrange/logrange#quick-start) to see how it works.
- _Kubernetes_. Logrange can be deployed as a log-aggregation system into a Kubernetes cluster. You can find how to run Logrange in Kubernetes [here](https://github.com/logrange/k8s) .

Logrange binaries are avialable for Linux and MacOs platforms on our [Download](link) page. You can run Logrange components either in a cloud or on-premises using hosted, virtualized or conteinerized soultions or a mix of them.

Of course, you can build it from [source](https://github.com/logrange/logrange)

### Gravitational starts to use Logrange for Gravity!
[Gravitational Inc.](https://gravitational.com/) starts to use Logrange for serving cluster logs infrastructure in their flagship product [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity/)! Logrange's components are deployed into the Gravity cluster for aggregating the cluster's application logs and providing an interface for working with them. There are 2 main use-cases Logrange addresses in Gravity:
1. Aggergating logs from the applications, that run in the Gravity cluster. Providing an inteface for search and downloading collected logs.
2. Forwarding aggregated logs to a 3rd party system using [Rsyslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsyslog) protocol.

Here is what Sasha Klizhentas (CTO of Gravitational Inc.) says about it:

> [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity) uses Logrange to collect and aggregate log data in the most restricted environments and provides
> our customers with ability to search, retain and forward logs to external log storage without compromising on security or storage.

### The future
Logrange is under active development. Our plan is to continue working on the following items:
- To support HA (High Availability)
- To provide more CLI features for working with application logs
- To support log-storage to meet high-end security standards
- To work on 3rd-party systems data integrations tools
- To work on deep-learning and data-analytics tools like "Anomalies Prediction", "hidden correlations" etc.

### Contact us
